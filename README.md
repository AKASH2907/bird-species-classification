# bird-species-classification
Inter species classification

This is an implementation of bird species classification on Python 3 and Keras with Tensorflow backend. The architecture consists of Mask R-CNN and ImageNet models end-to-end. ImageNet models used are Inception V3 and Inception ResNet V2.

The repository includes:
* Generate training data for the model
* Data Augmentation practices
* Generate bird crops using Mask R-CNN 
* Finetuning on Image Net models - Inception V3 & Inception ResNet V2
* Muli- stage Training
* Mask R-CNN and ImageNet Model combined end-to-end for testing purpose
* Evauation file for class averaged precision, recall and F1-scores.

The code is documented and designed to be easy to extend. If you use it in your research, please consider citing this repository (bibtex below). 

## Getting Started
 * [modify_data.py](https://github.com/AKASH2907/bird-species-classification/blob/master/modify_data.py) - This code is used to rename the files. For example: 10 - Type of Data Augmentation 01- Class of Bird 01 - Image Number - 100101.jpg (Image Name)
 * [data_augmentation.py](https://github.com/AKASH2907/bird-species-classification/blob/master/data_augmentation/data_augmentation.py) - Various types of data augmentation used to counter the challenge of large scale variation in illumination,scale, etc. and class imbalance.
 * [create_validation.py](https://github.com/AKASH2907/bird-species-classification/blob/master/create_validation.py) - Used to create Validation data randomly from the augmented training data.
* [gen_train_data_test_data.py](https://github.com/AKASH2907/bird-species-classification/blob/master/gen_train_data_test_data.py) - Generates X_train, Y_train, X_validation, Y_validation, X_test, Y_test
* [inception_v3_finetune.py](https://github.com/AKASH2907/bird-species-classification/blob/master/inception_v3_finetune.py) - Multi-stage Training on Mask R-CNN crops generated and then on data augmented original images.
* [inception_resnet_v2_finetune.py](https://github.com/AKASH2907/bird-species-classification/blob/master/inception_resnet_v2_finetune.py) - Multi-stage Training on Mask R-CNN crops generated and then on data augmented original images resized to 416x416.

## Data Augmentation
Data Augmentation has been done using [imgaug](https://imgaug.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/augmenters.html#affine).Table for data Augmentation done for different species is shared in data_augmentation folder.


## Mask R-CNN
Mask R-CNN on the whole image helped to localize birds in the image. Below are the examples of the birds detection from a high resolution image. As the Mask R-CNN is trained on COCO dataset and it has **bird** class, it carves out bird ROIs very perfectly.
